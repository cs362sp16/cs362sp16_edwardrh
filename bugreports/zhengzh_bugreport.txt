- Use unit and random tests to test classmates' written code
- Find and document at least three bugs

There were not any bugs that came initially very apparent from my
understanding. It could have been the possibility that my unit tests
and random test that were used to test my classmate's written code
may have not worked properly or worked even that well for that matter.
Possibly after test good tests, there is that high probability that
there are acutally bugs in his code, which honestly is actually very
likely/true. Such as 1) a logical error in a function, such as 
return the incorrect amount of money back for a card or payment of a
buy 2) missing of a certian step that would affect the gameplay of the
game overall and 3) possibly just another slightly variation of the 
situations previously stated, just of a different type of senario.
I suppose better unit tests and random tests could have been more
beneficial in the case.
