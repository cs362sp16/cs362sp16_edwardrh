- Implement Tarantula using gcov
- Describe the process on how to localize a bug
- Include any relevant code or files

- Generate gcov files for each test
- Attach information whether tests pass or fail
- Parse the gcov filesand using tarantula formula

My understanding on how to use Tarantula along with gcov, is very
limited. Describing the process would have to be minimal progress due
to a lack of better understanding in order to be successful with this
process, yet the general idea of how it should work is definetly 
greater and that I can further explain.
After generating gcov file for each test, a programmer can further
understand what is being analyzing and continuely have a greater
sense on what the is beign indicated by the program itself. Depending
on how good Tarantula is and how buggy the program being looked at is,
would depend on whether or not a certain test passes or fail through
this process.
Parsign the gcov filestand using the tarantula formula though, I am
not entirely sure what that mean, mostly because of the face possibly
that my current level and knowlegde of using Traantula, and extent
of vocabulary and terminology of such a process is very limited, 
whereas I am hoping to further enhance of what little I do know, as I
become more exposed and taught as time goes on.
