- Pick classmate working Dominion implementations
- Compare with diffdominion.c for several seeds
- Proceed until find difference (Write About This)

- How easy is it to decide who is correct?
- Discuss why not ideal case for differential testing

- Measure code coverage on both implementations (Discuss Results)
- Your randomm tester, if run more than 20 times,
  obtain at least 60% coverage of dominion.c
